# Knowledge Processing Technologies

This repository contains all the lab work done for the course ISTE-612 under Professor Jai Kang at RIT, NY.
Topics include internet middleware technologies, data and text analytics, and information visualization.

## Implementation of Information Retrieval algorithms

1. Incidence matrix
2. Inverted Index (usin list and binary tree) implementations
3. Positional Index implementation
4. Vector Space model with ranked retrieval

## Spell correction
1. Edit distance - similarity between two strings(using dynamic programming)

## Implementation of text mining and classification algorithms

1. Naive Bayes text classification (Bernoulli and Multinomial)
2. Clustering algorithms: K-means and heirarchical agglomerative clustering
